# Backslash
This is an open source initiative to develop and design a beautiful UI with powerful file Managing capibilities in android. I got the idea of this because there are a lot of open source file managers available but they all lack somewhere in UI part as compared to other paid apps and the free apps which are available has some fixed capibilities.

#### "As this is currently in development phase. There might be a lot of bugs and I haven't yet created the apk to publish on playstore under beta. I will publish the same as soon as the app is in a good state to be checked out by you people."

## For Developers
All android developers are most welcome to contribute to the project. I am also new to open source community. Any suggestions are also welcome to enhence and adding the functionalities. This is a project in it's initial state so, all beginers can also contribute. 

## Contributions -
Still waiting for someone to join the movement. :)
